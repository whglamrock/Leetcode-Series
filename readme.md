For each topic/special data structure, the typical use cases are summaized here

##### Binary Index Tree
* O(logN) time for update and getPrefixSum for an array
* count in an array, the numbers smaller/bigger than a number on its left/right. 
* Example question: [leetcode315](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/), [leetcode327](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/)

##### Dynamic Programming
Usually (or almost 99% of the case) what `dp[i][j]` means should be exactly same as what the question is asking for.
